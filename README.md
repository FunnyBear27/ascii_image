Ascii_image is my project in which I am going to learn to work with different image files.

Supported file extensions:
PNG(currently in developement)

The information there will be added when I move on to another type.
The final goal here is to be able to make an ascii representation of an image. It may change over time

To build and run the project: 
1. Run "make" in the root dir of the project
2. launch "bin" from the command line. "bin -f path/to/your/file/filename.*"
